# vu-thunderrun
Modification for Battlefield 3 (using the Venice Unleashed framework) bringing the Thunder Run map to multiplayer.

This mod removes the singleplayer logic from Thunder Run and adds multiplayer logic. Use **sp_tank ConquestLarge0 1** in your server MapList.

When converting this to different maps, look for lines marked `-- CHANGE`.

While there exists an older version of this idea, replacing the terrain of an existing multiplayer map, that approach was found to be not ideal. This approach offers a solution to our issues.
