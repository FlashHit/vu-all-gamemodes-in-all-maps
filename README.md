# vu-all-gamemodes-in-all-maps

Modification for Battlefield 3 (using the Venice Unleashed framework) allowing singleplayer and co-op maps to be played in multiplayer with a universal solution, with the same solution is now possible to add any gamemode to any map, this is the purpose of this mod.
This mod is ready to be played so unless you find any bugs it should be good to go.

This is a fork from the original mod [vu-spterrains](https://github.com/SassythSasqutch/vu-spterrains) from *SassythSasqutch*:

**This mod is still WIP, I'll update the mod with more gamemodes when I have time.**


## Important


**It's mandatory to download my [CustomLevelLoader](https://github.com/keku645/CustomLevelLoader) and [2dTrees-Removal](https://github.com/keku645/2dTrees-Removal), gamemodes have been ported based on the layout of such custom maps.**
                         

## Known issues

Due the lack of Rime (at the moment of writing these lines) it is not possible to replace textures, thats why there aren't those "orange lines" that shows the player where the actual OOB of the map is.
